The event scripts are there to write the actual functions of your Discord bot. 
Each event script is executed once in a specific situation and also provides data that your bot can use each time it is executed:

- GATEWAY_READY()
- GET_INTERACTION()
- MESSAGE_CREATE()
- MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD()
- MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE()
- REACTION_TO_ROLE()
