# ⭐ GMDI | GameMaker DiscordAPI Integration
GMDI (GameMaker DiscordAPI Integration) is a library (in the form of a yymps file that can be imported into GameMaker Studio) that offers an easy way to program even complex Discord bots with GameMaker. GMDI works with the live connection to the Discord gateway and with HTTP requests. 

## ⭐ Features
- a live connection to the Discord gateway and receive all Discord events
- an asynchronous system for HTTP requests and gateway connections with corresponding interception of HTTP errors and Discord Api errors
- easy response to interactions (buttons, text inputs, commands, select menus) thanks to GMDI's automatic response system
- almost all important http requests are available, new ones are added and updated
- simple building of objects that are sent to discord (such as a message: create_message("**Hello!**"))
- your bot can serve several Discord guilds at the same time and also process direct messages
- easy to attach files (.zip, .png and more). Compatible with GameMaker **Surfaces**, **Sprites** and **file paths** with supported formats (see [media_types](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Media_Type))
- easier and faster configuration of your Discord bot, so you can start programming immediately.
- thanks to the **house()** system, you can easily redirect interactions to a function so that you have all the code for that interaction in one script.
